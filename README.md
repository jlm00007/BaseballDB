Additionally, we go beyond the confines of the ballpark by offering users the ability to explore the temperature data of any city with a simple search feature. Whether you're planning on attending the game, or you are interested for fantasy purposes, our application is ideal for you.

Chat GPT was very useful when it came to filling in our tables with mock data. For the stats data, the structure of the stats table was given to the chatbot. Then, the following prompts were used: "Can you generate 100 lines of mock data for the stat table? You don't have to link the stats to specific teams." and "Can you do PID 90-300?". The commands were separated in an effort to not overwhelm Chat GPT.
