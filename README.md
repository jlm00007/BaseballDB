We're creating a comprehensive application that seamlessly integrates weather analytics with team performance metrics. Whether it's understanding how temperature fluctuations impact batting averages or uncovering the influence of weather patterns on win-loss records, our application provides insight into the correlation between climate and baseball. Additionally, we go beyond the confines of the ballpark by offering users the ability to explore the temperature data of any city with a simple search feature. Whether you're planning on attending the game, or you are interested for fantasy purposes, our application is ideal for you.
